# Hi there!

I’m Jiri. My sanity requires coffee, mountains, sports and fiddling with tech. **I love Annelies, Janne, Sam, Mitte and Wietse!**

Long ago I started my career as a software engineer, but today I [lead a team of product managers](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jiridejagere). 

Product Management is interesting and challenging! You get to work with many people from different backgrounds and industries. Some are colleagues. Some are customers. **Some understand technology. Many don’t.**

**Building elegant, commercially successful solutions for complex problems** is how I get my professional kicks. I work on a daily basis with product managers, software architects, support engineers, sales reps and customers to:

* Define product strategy and roadmap
* Crystallize features and release plans
* Design processes to support the products 
* Enable sales people to sell the value

But the best part is that there is always something new to learn. Always something new to dig into. **You're never done, but never bored**!
