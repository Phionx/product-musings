# Hi there!

I’m Jiri. I'm a techie and **dad of four little wonders**. My sanity requires coffee, mountains, sports and fiddling with tech. 

Long ago I started my career as a software engineer. I've ventured into many different roles, but today I **lead a team of product managers**. We're building state of the art cloud applications. 

Building software products is interesting and challenging! You get to work with many people from different backgrounds and industries. Some are colleagues. Some are customers. **Some understand technology. Many don’t.**

**Building elegant, commercially successful solutions** for real and complex problems is how I get my professional kicks. I work on a daily basis with product managers, software architects, support engineers, sales reps and customers to:

* Define product vision, strategy and roadmap
* Crystallize features and release plans
* Design processes to support the products 
* Enable the organisation to sell the value

But the best part is that there is always something new to learn. Always something new to dig into. **You're never done, but never bored**!
