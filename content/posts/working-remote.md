Five years ago, the company I work for announced that they were closing all satellite offices around the globe. From then on, all of us would be working from home. That sounds like a great deal, and it is. But it also comes with a whole set of new challenges. With this post I want to share a few tips, learned the hard way, on making work from home a success.

I was a true office junkie. Every day I would commute to our Brussels or Rotterdam offices for days packed with face-to-face meetings. I'd go really early and stay late, just to get a few hours of time alone to get some *real work* done. I'd spend 3 hours a day in the car, on average. Time I mostly spent in conference calls - handsfree of course - that I adeptly planned in those inproductive hours of the commute. It was how we operated. All of us, not just me.

So you can imagine that the announcement to close all satellite offices came as a huge shock. First of all, it sounded like an awesome benefit to not having to commute anymore. But at the same time we all had our doubts about whether or not it could work. Those doubts were not unfounded. Remember that we were going cold turkey. There were no offices to go to anymore!

## Challenge #1: Separate work from life

{{< image name="work-life" ext="png" alt="working from home requires separating work from life">}}

When I first started to work from home, I just couldn't believe it! No more hours wasted commuting. No more colleagues interrupting deep work. Fewer and shorter meetings. You feel incredibly productive. You get more stuff done, while spending less time on work. The work-life balance starts tilting the other way too. Instead of having early morning commutes, I bring the kids to school. I run quick errants while taking a break. I cook dinner for the family. All of that in addition to a full day's of work. 

But there is a dark side to it too. The boundaries between work and life start to fade quickly. Before, work was the office and life was at home. Now everything is mixed up. Now that sink full of dirty dishes, the laundry, the errants all get mixed into your todo-list. If you think reaching inbox-zero is hard, imaging mixing all household chores into that.

To make working from home work for you, you need to separate your work from the rest of your life. Here are a few tips and tricks I picked up over time that work well for me:

1. Have a separate space, with a door that you can close, to work in. This has three big benefits. First, you'll have some piece and quiet for working while other family members are at home. Secondly, when you get into that room your mind will be focused on work, not on doing those dirty dishes or mowing the lawn. Lastly, leaving the room and closing the door behind you has a similar mental effect as leaving the company office. You're done with work for the day and can focus on family life ...
2. Make clear arrangements with yourself and your family. If the door is closed, you're not to be bothered for folding linnen, running a quick errant or looking after the kids. It's as if you're not there. The temptation to ask something from you, or for you to do something for someone else is big. But letting yourself get distracted from work implies getting back into it later.
3. Not having to drive to the office to work, also implies that your home has become your office. There is a good chance you're never done. Set boundaries to your working hours to protect yourself and be disciplined about it. It's too easy to get behind the computer for a *few more minutes* and do a little more work. Everyone needs down time and, if you work where you live, you need to be very explicit about when is down time. 

Implementing these few simple things will help you separate work from the rest of your life. Trust me, you'll need to if you want to be happy remote worker!

## Challenge #2: Ban distractions

{{< image name="ban-distractions" ext="png" alt="working remote requires banning distractions">}}

When discussing challenge #1 I already touched upon the distractions that are plentiful in and around the house. But today, people and chores are not the only distractions. Our devices bring us an endless stream of triggers that fight for our attention. It is very easy to get distracted and once you're off scrolling your timeline it is really hard to refocus and get back to work. 

Office environments introduce a - hopefully - healthy dose of social control. You are just less likely to allow yourself to be distracted by these triggers. Or you're afraid your boss will catch you scrolling through your Instagram timeline. When working remotely, there is no such control.

So you have to create some rules for yourself to ensure that you don't let yourself get distracted. Because if you do, you'll pay the price later by having to catch up for the time wasted.

## Challenge #3: Get out!

{{< image name="get-out" ext="png" alt="working remote get out">}}

For the first year or so, I worked exclusively from home. I went out of the house to run errants or for sports. That was it! The only *real people* I talked to were my wife and kids. Ok, I'm exaggerating, but honestly after a year it really felt like that. 

We all need social interactions. Even introverts, like myself, have the need to get out and see other people. To have conversations about something other than household chores, the next vacation destination or how the kids' day at school was.

There are different ways to achieve this. On a sunny day you can go to the park and work there. You can take a trip to the coffeeshop and work there. My solution was to get a desk at a coworking place. I go there two to three times a week. It is a bike ride away, which means I get a little workout and my head is clear. There are other people there who work in different businesses and industries, but that are all in a similar situation as you are. You'll love the atmosphere of productivity mixed with social activities. 

## Summary

Working remotely is awesome! But it requires discipline from yourself and your loved ones. Follow these simple tips and tricks and you'll love it!

1. Set up a space for work. It's best if that space has a door you can close.
2. Agree on a few rules so the boundaries between work and family are clear for all. Be displined about banning distractions. 
3. Get out and meet people!
