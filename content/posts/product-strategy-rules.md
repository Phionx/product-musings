Managing stakeholders - and their expectations - is the toughest part of being a product manager. It is a careful balancing act. You want everyone to be positive about the product and its roadmap. But you also want to make sure that expectations are realistic.

## Walk the tightrope

As a product manager you work with many stakeholders: customers, sales, support, professional services, finance, ... All have different views and need different things.

- "If only we had this, we would beat every competitor every time!" ~ presales
- "Commitment on delivering this makes or breaks my deal!" ~ sales
- "It's only a small thing, but it makes a big difference for me!" ~ customer
- "If we don't do this, the customer will go away!" ~ support
- "We need to reduce COGS to improve margins!" ~ finance

Your inbox is filled with feature requests. Most make perfect sense. You have endless ways to spend budget, but there's only so much to go around. You can't ever give everyone what they want, so you'll need to manage expectations. It's like walking the tightrope towards your product vision while balancing stakeholder expectations and available budget.

## Keep your eye on the target

This is why product strategy is important. If you've got the strategy part right, everything else is ~~easy~~ easier. Do your homework. Clearly document and communicate the vision and strategy. You and your stakeholders need to understand where you're taking the product.

When building the roadmap, you have to be deliberate about placing bets. Dig deep and understand if and how a feature contributes to the end goal. Prioritize work that pulls into that direction. That way you can look past the pile of features and push the product forward towards the target. 

Your strategy should be based upon research and evidence. Use that information as a frame of reference for making and defending roadmap decisions. The only right direction is the one set by the product vision and strategy.

## Take the time to get things right

While all of this might seem obvious, it is not. 

- Launching a new product, you might be tempted to jump straight in and build the solution everyone needs for the problem everyone has. But are you sure what the problem is, and is it really worth solving? And is the solution you have in mind the right one?

- Taking over a mature product, you might be tempted to roll with the punches and continue down the path taken. But is that path the right one?

Take the time to properly define the product strategy. Revisit it regularly to validate that it is still the right strategy. Don't repeat the mistakes we've all made before! :wink:
