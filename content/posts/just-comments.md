Some argue that a blog without comments is not really a blog. I agree. Disqus is the most broadly used comments solution out there, but I really hate it. Here is a great alternative!

[Disqus](https://disqus.com) is the 10.000 pound gorilla when it comes to blog comments. Many use it, because it is free, if you're ok with them making money by serving ads on your blog. Others use the paid version, which serves no ads, and is just as quick and easy to integrate into your blog as the free version. But for me, Disqus just does not cut it. 

First of all, I do not want them to serve ads on my blog. My blog is 100% ad-free. Paid plans allow you to remove the ads, but that is not my only beef.

If you want people to find your content, you need to rank well in Google. Google is increasingly ranking fast sites higher. Disqus adds an insane amount of resources to your pages, making them slower to render. And that hurts your search ranking.

And finally, you have to remember that nothing is really free. If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer. You're the product being sold. I do not want anyone to monetise information about readers of my content (however few it may be :smile:).

It took me a while to find a good alternative, because my criteria are pretty tough:

- It has to be a service. This is a static site and I don't want to host an application. 
- It doesn't have to be free, but it has to be cheap. 
- It has to be light-weight, with no privacy issues. You know ... GDPR!

I've been using one for a while now and I really like it. I'm using [Just-Comments](https://just-comments.com) by [Alex Rudenko](https://twitter.com/orKoN). It's not free, but it is dirt cheap. It's built in a smart, light-weight way. It just works. I love it!
